# 🚀 Generative AI Internship Tasks — Prodigy Infotech
This repository contains my work for the Generative AI internship, covering text generation, image generation, and Markov Chain-based text generation using Python and pre-trained models.

📌 Task 1: Text Generation using GPT-2
In this task, I explored GPT-2, a transformer model developed by OpenAI, for generating human-like text from a given prompt using the transformers library.

💬 Prompt Example:
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Shreya...

✨ AI Response Example:
She was beautiful. She had a beautiful face. She was part of a beautiful family...

🧠 What I Learned:

Basics of GPT-2 and text generation

Using Hugging Face pipelines

Running AI models on Google Colab

📁 Files:

task1_gpt2_text_generation.ipynb — Colab notebook for Task 1

📌 Task 2: Image Generation using Pre-trained Models
In this task, I explored Stable Diffusion to generate images from text prompts using the diffusers library from Hugging Face.

💬 Prompt Example:
A futuristic city with flying cars

🧠 What I Learned:

How image generation models like Stable Diffusion work

Creating images from text prompts

Using Hugging Face’s diffusers library

Running models with GPU in Google Colab

Generated images (e.g., task2_image_futuristic_city_flying_cars.png)

📌 Task 3: Text Generation using Markov Chains
In this task, I generated text using Markov Chains, building simple probabilistic models from input text.

💬 Input Example:
Engines roar. Wheels spin. Speed thrills. Cars chase dreams.

✨ AI Response Example:
Wheels spin. Speed thrills. Cars chase dreams. Engines roar.

🧠 What I Learned:

How Markov Chains model text sequences

Writing Python code to build and generate text using chains

Running in Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
