- Installed and loaded the model with Hugging Face's `pipeline`
- Gave a prompt: `"Once upon a time, there was a girl named Shreya"` 😄
- Generated AI-written text based on that

## 🧠 Skills Gained
- Basics of Transformer models (GPT-2)
- Text generation using Hugging Face
- Working in Python and Google Colab
