# Prodigy Infotech Internship
 *GPT2-Text-Generation & Image-Generation*


**Task 1 - GPT-2 Text Generation | Task 2 - Image Generation**
---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is part of my **Generative AI Internship** at *Prodigy Infotech*.
It includes:

* **Task 1:** Text generation using GPT-2
* **Task 2:** Image generation using Stable Diffusion

---

## ✨ Task 1 - GPT-2 Text Generation

### 🔍 Objective

To generate coherent and contextually relevant text using the GPT-2 language model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library.

### 💡 What I Did

* Used Google Colab to run GPT-2
* Installed and loaded the model using Hugging Face’s `pipeline`
* Provided prompt: `"Once upon a time, there was a girl named Shreya"` 
* Generated AI-written text

### 🧠 Skills Gained

* Basics of Transformer models (GPT-2)
* Text generation using Hugging Face
* Python + Google Colab
* Uploading projects to GitHub

---

## 🖼️ Task 2 - Image Generation

### 🔍 Objective

To generate creative images from text prompts using a pre-trained model (Stable Diffusion).

### 💡 What I Did

* Used Google Colab for running image generation code
* Provided a custom prompt as a car enthusiast:
  *"A futuristic city with flying cars"* 
* Saved output as: `futuristic_city_flying_cars.png`

### 🧠 Skills Gained

* Basics of text-to-image generation
* Hands-on with Stable Diffusion
* Managing Colab notebooks + outputs
