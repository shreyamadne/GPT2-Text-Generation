# Generative AI Internship — Prodigy Infotech
This repository contains my work for the Generative AI internship, covering text and image generation tasks using pretrained models.

📌 Task 1: Text Generation using GPT-2
In this task, I explored GPT-2, a transformer model developed by OpenAI, for generating human-like text based on a given prompt.
I used the transformers library from Hugging Face in Google Colab.

💬 Prompt Example:
"Once upon a time, there was a girl named Shreya..."

✨ AI Response:
"She was beautiful. She had a beautiful face. She was part of a beautiful family..."

🧠 What I Learned:

Basics of GPT-2 and text generation

Using Hugging Face pipelines

Running AI models on Google Colab

How to upload code and notebooks to GitHub

📁 Files:
task1_gpt2_text_generation.ipynb — Colab notebook for Task 1

📌 Task 2: Image Generation using Pretrained Models
In this task, I explored Stable Diffusion to generate images from text prompts using pretrained models.
I worked with Hugging Face’s diffusers library in Google Colab.

💬 Prompt Example:
1️⃣ "A futuristic city with flying cars"

🧠 What I Learned:

How image generation models like Stable Diffusion work

How to create images from text prompts

Using Hugging Face’s diffusers

Running with GPU (T4) in Google Colab
